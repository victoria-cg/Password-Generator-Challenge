# Password-Generator-Challenge

## Description
This was the module 3 project for the UT/EdX coding bootcamp, which tasked me with completing provided Javascript code in order to make a function that would generate a random password meeting certain criteria. The project allowed me to gain practical expericence with Javascript variables, data types, methods, loops, and functions. This included problem solving around how to combine these different JavaScript components to solve a problem, in this case to prompt a user for critera and generate a random password string in response. I learned how to prompt users for input, how to choose random items from an array, and how to use the '.split' method demonstrated in class to convert data from one type to another.

EdX Xpert AI consulted/used as reference material for use of “+=” concatenation at line 59 to debug that code and fill in the finalPassword variable with all the looped randomly selected characters.

Collaboration during office hours with class TA Walter Perry and classmate Carlos Asencio-Morales: They assisted with troubleshooting by suggesting I use "confirm" booleans for user input type, as well as suggesting that I use strings and concatenation to combine the user responses.
